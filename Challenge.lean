# The comparator challenge: what this repository claims, stated against Mathlib alone

This file is the **trusted statement of record** for `leanprover/comparator`
(see `comparator/kernel.json`, `comparator/capstone.json`, and `lake test`).

It imports *nothing but Mathlib*, and it re-declares — verbatim — every definition that
occurs in the two theorems being certified, followed by those two theorems with `sorry`
proofs.  `Solution.lean` merely imports the real development.  Comparator then checks that

1. every constant in the transitive closure of these statements is **identical** in the
   challenge and the solution environments (so the definitions below really are the ones
   the repository proves things about — a divergent `complexity` or `kernelViolators`
   would be caught here),
2. the solution's proofs use **no axioms beyond those permitted** by the config, and
3. the solution's environment is **re-accepted by the Lean kernel** from a fresh export.

Consequently, auditing this repository's headline claims reduces to reading *this file*:
if the definitions below say what you think they say, comparator has verified the rest.

## The two configurations, and why there are two

The repository's docstrings claim a specific *axiom stratification*, and the two configs
pin it down mechanically:

* `comparator/kernel.json` certifies `TH.superlinear_of_kernel` — the Stage-1 reduction
  (K) ⟹ M4 — under the three standard axioms **only**: `propext`, `Quot.sound`,
  `Classical.choice`.  No cited literature enters here.
* `comparator/capstone.json` certifies `TH.superlinear_of_middleBand` — the conditional
  capstone — under those three **plus** the single cited axiom
  `Subspace.evertseSchlickewei` (the Subspace Theorem, Evertse–Schlickewei
  `S`-arithmetic form), which is therefore also declared below, verbatim, so that a
  reader sees exactly what is being taken on faith.

Note that permitting an axiom by name is *not* a loophole: comparator compares the types
of permitted axioms across the two environments too, so the solution cannot smuggle in a
`Subspace.evertseSchlickewei : False`.

Nothing here is proved; the `sorry`s are the point.  The proofs live in `TH.KernelReduction`
and `TH.CapstoneM4`.
